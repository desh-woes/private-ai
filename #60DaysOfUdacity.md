#Introduction
This file is a documentation of my learning journey over a 60 days period in attempt to optimise my learning from the `Secure and Private AI` challenge course by Udacity. 

>**Challenge Start Date:** 27th June, 2019.

### Day 1:
**Update** — 27/06/2019
1. Today, I will be working on understanding the formulas presented in the #l4_loc_glob_diff_priv module. They are quite confusing and require a lot of time to understand.

### Day 2:
**Update** — 28/06/2019
1. It's about time for me to complete the segment on Local and global Differential privacy. The projects in this segment have been super interesting. From learning that functions such as the sum and mean functions are not differentially private to learning about data conditioned sensitivity. I am really enjoying this part of the course. #60daysofudacity

### Day 3:
**Update** — 29/06/2019
1. Continued working in the local and global differential Privacy section. Almost done
2. Revisited the concept of data conditioned Privacy

### Day 4:
**Update** — 30/06/2019
1. Haha. Thanks for the tag @sumanyurosha!. Today,
I am resting after a long week of working. Hoping to get back to work fully energized tomorrow.

### Day 5:
**Update** — 01/07/2019
1. As always, @sumanyurosha is here to keep me in check! Thank you very much. I was actually busy with other stuff and forgot to post my updates.
Day 5: #60daysofudacity
Today I completed the lesson 4 on local and global differential privacy and I am currently looking at resources shared by @hrmello to help understand the formula's shared in episode 7, 8, 9 of the lesson.

### Day 6:
**Update** — 02/07/2019
1. Today I revisited episode 7, 8, and 9 of the lesson on local and global differential privacy. I also studied @rishisridhar96’s notes on github regarding the formalization of differential privacy. Finally, I did a bit of digging into the Laplacian Distribution.

### Day 7:
**Update** — 03/07/2019
1. I am now working on Lesson 6 i.e #l5_diff_privacy_dl. Still struggling with some formulas as well as access to internet but I remain dedicated to the course. There's some interesting concepts on how to modify differential privacy for deep learning and I'm looking forward to further exploration.

I'd also like to encourage @sumanyurosha and @ynawal to share their updates.

### Day 8:
**Update** — 04/07/2019
1. Today I continued exploring how differential privacy can be applied to deep Learning. It's exciting how you can train multiple models separately and bring them together to label an entirely different dataset.

2. The pate analysis is a bit confusing though. I am not able to go very in-depth because of internet constraints but tomorrow hopefully I'd get internet and explore the pate analysis even further.

3. Today I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96 and @hrmello to share their updates if they have not already done so.

### Day 9:
**Update** — 05/07/2019
1. Today I took a step back to explore a library that is used a lot in the field of Machine learning in general. I explored numpy and numpy operations. I could definitely see a lot of similarities between the numpy vector operations and the vector operations that are carried out in tensors too.

    It is a good library for beginners like me in the program to explore.

2. I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96, @hrmello, @sumanyurosha, @ynawal, @ash3ax to keep going with this wave and share their learnings with the rest of us :sunglasses:

### Day 10:
**Update** — 06/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning from the slack Channels through answering questions and reading answers to the questions asked by others. I think they are very insightful to go through and there's definitely a lot to learn from helping others as a beginner.

2. I'd like to encourage @undasu, @seeratpal91, and @shivshankar.hc to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 11:
**Update** — 07/07/2019

Today was a light day for me, I had to get some rest in preparation for the new week. However, today I was still able to:

1. Go over some python data structures and algorithms, in preparation for an interview. Today, I covered Array, stacks and queues.

2. I also covered some of the content on Pate analysis. I cannot say I fully grasp it yet but it's coming along quite nicely.

I'd like to thank everyone who reminds me to keep up with the challenge and I'd also like to challenge

@workwithpurpose, @sumanyurosha and @hrmello to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 12:
**Update** — 08/07/2019
1. Today I did some transfer learning of my own.:joy:, I started to explore the tensor-flow course on Udacity to see how applicable the learnings from Pytorch are in tensor-flow. Surprisingly, they are not so different at all, the general concept and approach to building deep learning models are almost the same and it is refreshing to know how much knowledge can be transferred from this course to other courses.

2. I'd like to thank @workwithpurpose and @arkachkrbrty for the constant motivation and I'd like to motivate @sumanyurosha, @gogulaanand02, @ash3ax to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 13:
**Update** — 09/07/2019
1. Today I went through the archives to visit old responses to some questions asked about the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning.

2. I also created my personal repository for [daily](https://github.com/desh-woes/private-ai) updates

3. Finally, today I'd like to thank @Arka and @Anna Scott for reminding me to share my updates as well as I motivate @Artur Freitas Gonçalves, @Elimu Michael, to share their updates.
