# Introduction
This file is a documentation of my learning journey over a 60 days period in attempt to optimise my learning from the `Secure and Private AI` challenge course by Udacity. 

>**Challenge Start Date:** 27th June, 2019.

### Day 1:
**Update** — 27/06/2019
1. Today, I will be working on understanding the formulas presented in the #l4_loc_glob_diff_priv module. They are quite confusing and require a lot of time to understand.

### Day 2:
**Update** — 28/06/2019
1. It's about time for me to complete the segment on Local and global Differential privacy. The projects in this segment have been super interesting. From learning that functions such as the sum and mean functions are not differentially private to learning about data conditioned sensitivity. I am really enjoying this part of the course. #60daysofudacity

### Day 3:
**Update** — 29/06/2019
1. Continued working in the local and global differential Privacy section. Almost done
2. Revisited the concept of data conditioned Privacy

### Day 4:
**Update** — 30/06/2019
1. Haha. Thanks for the tag @sumanyurosha!. Today,
I am resting after a long week of working. Hoping to get back to work fully energized tomorrow.

### Day 5:
**Update** — 01/07/2019
1. As always, @sumanyurosha is here to keep me in check! Thank you very much. I was actually busy with other stuff and forgot to post my updates.
Day 5: #60daysofudacity
Today I completed the lesson 4 on local and global differential privacy and I am currently looking at resources shared by @hrmello to help understand the formula's shared in episode 7, 8, 9 of the lesson.

### Day 6:
**Update** — 02/07/2019
1. Today I revisited episode 7, 8, and 9 of the lesson on local and global differential privacy. I also studied @rishisridhar96’s notes on github regarding the formalization of differential privacy. Finally, I did a bit of digging into the Laplacian Distribution.

### Day 7:
**Update** — 03/07/2019
1. I am now working on Lesson 6 i.e #l5_diff_privacy_dl. Still struggling with some formulas as well as access to internet but I remain dedicated to the course. There's some interesting concepts on how to modify differential privacy for deep learning and I'm looking forward to further exploration.

I'd also like to encourage @sumanyurosha and @ynawal to share their updates.

### Day 8:
**Update** — 04/07/2019
1. Today I continued exploring how differential privacy can be applied to deep Learning. It's exciting how you can train multiple models separately and bring them together to label an entirely different dataset.

2. The pate analysis is a bit confusing though. I am not able to go very in-depth because of internet constraints but tomorrow hopefully I'd get internet and explore the pate analysis even further.

3. Today I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96 and @hrmello to share their updates if they have not already done so.

### Day 9:
**Update** — 05/07/2019
1. Today I took a step back to explore a library that is used a lot in the field of Machine learning in general. I explored numpy and numpy operations. I could definitely see a lot of similarities between the numpy vector operations and the vector operations that are carried out in tensors too.

    It is a good library for beginners like me in the program to explore.

2. I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96, @hrmello, @sumanyurosha, @ynawal, @ash3ax to keep going with this wave and share their learnings with the rest of us :sunglasses:

### Day 10:
**Update** — 06/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning from the slack Channels through answering questions and reading answers to the questions asked by others. I think they are very insightful to go through and there's definitely a lot to learn from helping others as a beginner.

2. I'd like to encourage @undasu, @seeratpal91, and @shivshankar.hc to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 11:
**Update** — 07/07/2019

Today was a light day for me, I had to get some rest in preparation for the new week. However, today I was still able to:

1. Go over some python data structures and algorithms, in preparation for an interview. Today, I covered Array, stacks and queues.

2. I also covered some of the content on Pate analysis. I cannot say I fully grasp it yet but it's coming along quite nicely.

I'd like to thank everyone who reminds me to keep up with the challenge and I'd also like to challenge

@workwithpurpose, @sumanyurosha and @hrmello to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 12:
**Update** — 08/07/2019
1. Today I did some transfer learning of my own.:joy:, I started to explore the tensor-flow course on Udacity to see how applicable the learnings from Pytorch are in tensor-flow. Surprisingly, they are not so different at all, the general concept and approach to building deep learning models are almost the same and it is refreshing to know how much knowledge can be transferred from this course to other courses.

2. I'd like to thank @workwithpurpose and @arkachkrbrty for the constant motivation and I'd like to motivate @sumanyurosha, @gogulaanand02, @ash3ax to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 13:
**Update** — 09/07/2019
1. Today I went through the archives to visit old responses to some questions asked about the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning.

2. I also created my personal repository for [daily](https://github.com/desh-woes/private-ai) updates

3. Finally, today I'd like to thank @Arka and @Anna Scott for reminding me to share my updates as well as I motivate @Artur Freitas Gonçalves, @Elimu Michael, to share their updates.

### Day 14:
**Update** - 11/07/2019
1. After a very long day, today I was able to glance throught the content breifly as well as read through the tons of slack mesages I have been unable to read since yesterday when I was offline and at work till very late at Night. I am seriously waiting for this week to be over so I can spend much more quality time working on the course.

### Day 15:
**Update** - 12/07/2019
1. First, I'd like to thank @Arka, @Mohit and @Anna Scott for the constant motivation to post my updates. This week has been a really busy one for me and I have been really busy with work.

2. Today however I continued with covering some of the content on deep learning with Tensorflow. Today I was able to replicate the cats and dogs image classification exercise with Tensorflow. I am still struggling with running the model on Google collab as it tells me I run out of ram but I hope to figure that out soon as it worked earlier in the day with about 80% accuracy.

3. Today, i'd also like to encourage @Perez Ogayo, @Sumanyu Rosha, and @Elimu Michael to share their update.

### Day 16:
**Update** - 13/07/2019
1. Today I spent about an hour catching up on unread slack messages as I have been unable to do that since yesterday because of work. I am looking forward to finally resting tommorow and hope to get back on track with the course.

### Day 17:
**Update** - 14/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning about down-sizing, max pooling which are used for image classification algorithms in deep learning.

### Day 18:
**Update** - 15/07/2019
1. Today I was finally able to resume work on the secure and private AI course, I was not able to make the like Q&A session with Robert Wagner but I watched the video on youtube and got some tips regarding Differential privacy's current limitations and the areas of growth.

2. It is always refreshing getting expert tips. I want to thank @Mohit and @Arka for the constant motivation for me to share my updates. It has been tough in the past week but now I feel much more refreshed and good to move on with the course and engaging with the community more.

3. I'd also like to challenge @Sumanyu Rosha, @Elimu Michael, @Henrique Mello to share or keep sharing their updates if they have not already.

### Day 19:
**Update** - 16/07/2019
1. Finally back on track, today I completed the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning. I got stuck many times but was helped a lot today by @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor and @Gogulaanand R. Thank you both for aiding my learnings. I really appreciate.

2. I'd like to motivate @Anna Scott, @Mohit, @Arka, @Abhishek Tandon, @Stark, to keep doing great stuff and pushing boundaries with this course. I have been seeing a lot of amazing posts.

3. Finally, I am looking for a buddy to help me with completing the project for differential privacy in deep learning. It is a bit confusing and I need guidance to work on it tomorrow, if you are available, please let me know.

### Day 20:
**Update** - 17/07/2019
1. Today, I spent a good amount of time on a call with my brothers @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor and @Dammy to get clarification on how to best approach and solve the problem introduced in module 5 i.e differential privacy with deep learning. @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor was very helpful and I think I am now in a position to carry on with the assignment. I'd see how tomorrow goes.

2. 'd like to thank @Arka, @Mohit, @Anna Scott, for their dedication to the #60daysofudacity and their constant effort to motivate others on the group. Finally, I'd like to motivate @Sumanyu Rosha, @Gogulaanand R, @Abhishek Tandon to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 21:
**Update** - 18/07/2019
1. Today was an interesting day as I got to spend quality time on the final project for #l5_diff_privacy_dl. I have gone through all the steps of separating the training set into different private sets, training the models and using them to label the existing models. Currently, my Pate analysis, however, does not seem to be right but I am sure it can be fixed easily and I'd go back to look at it at another time.

2. Id like to thank @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor, @Diego fro their support today in helping me make progress with the project and I'd like to encourage @Sumanyu Rosha. @Anna Scott, @Mohit, @ThienAn, @Agata [OR, USA] to keep working and sharing their updates.

### Day 23:
**Update** - 20/07/2019
1. Today I completed my [Portfolio Website](https://oluwarotimi-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) and deployed it on Heroku. This is a result of a web design course I have been taking alongside this course which I just got the certificate for. I look forward to more web development project and hopefully some AI based applications deployed on web.

2. I also looked over some concepts on the Udacity free tensor-flow course. It's great to explore some of these libraries once in a while to get a general understanding of deep learning.

### Day 24:
**Update** - 21/07/2019
1. Today I joined a call with my fellow Nigerians from the #sg_nigerian group, to discuss the projects and progress made in the course so far. I was amazing having @Dammy as the host and being with other Nigerians like @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor and @Temitope Oladokun.

2. Also today, I Started exploring federated learning. Still a lot of questions regarding the difference between federated learning and differentially private deep learning but I am getting some really good answers to my questions thanks to @Gogulaanand R, @sourav kumar and @Alison Davey.

3. Thanks to @Arka for the constant motivation. I really love what you are doing with the Anime image generation. I'm a big anime fan.

### Day 33:
**Update** - 30/07/2019
1. Still trying to figure out how to get over the federated learning project. Asking and answering questions on the slack channel.

2. Had to brush up on my Java in preparation for my interview. This is still taking a bulk of my time and I am working on data structures and Algorithms using the Udacity DSA nano degree. Currently studying recursion (This is very brain draining!).

3. I am excited about @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor’s session coming up, I have cast my vote for a time and date on the poll created and shared by @Dammy. My #sg_nigerian group mates doing amazing stuff. also shoutout to @Arka for the cool projects and constant motivation.

4. I'd like to motivate @Yemi, @Gogulaanand R, @ThienAn, @Henrique Mello, @Berenice, to keep being amazing and sharing their updates.

### Day 34:
**Update** - 31/07/2019

### Day 35:
**Update** - 1/08/2019
1. I am glad to be in the last month of this challenge course, now working on powering through the last two modules left so I can learn all there is to be learnt before the end of the course.

2. Still working on the federated learning project. It was a busy day at work so was not able to do much but I am still on track with my deadlines hopefully.

### Day 36:
**Update** - 2/08/2019
1. Today, I took a break from the project and decided to go through my notes and re-learn some of the concepts I found confusing on my first attempt. I always find this process useful to re-enforce my learning and I try to go through it for any kind of studies I am engaged with.

2. I also did some work on my Udacity Data structures and Algorithms course, Have some pressing deadlines on that front and I am trying my best to manage both programs.

### Day 37:
**Update** - 3/08/2019
1. It was a super productive day for me today as I prioritised completing the Federated learning project. And although I am currently experiencing difficulties completing the project due to some conflict in Pysyft, I was able to build the federated learning model following the tutorials provided by Open mind themselves. you can access the tutorial via this link (https://blog.openmined.org/upgrade-to-federated-learning-in-10-lines/).

2. Thanks to @Berenice, @Archit, @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor, @Sumanyu Roshaand @Arka, for providing answers to my questions today, It really means a lot to me. You can access my GitHub repository via this link (https://github.com/desh-woes/private-ai/blob/master/%2360DaysOfUdacity.md). I implement all of my projects within the notebook.

3. Big ups to @Temitope Oladokun, @Yemi, @Dammy, @Henrique Mello, @ThienAn, @Stark, @Agata [OR, USA] for making it this far in the program. We are in the finishing stage and I'd like to motivate them to keep moving.

### Day 38:
**Update** - 4/08/2019
1. Today I joined the study group #sg_nigerian meetup and which was led by @Jethro Sam-Marcus today. We discussed working on a project for the Project showcase.

2.  Continued reviewing the error in my #l6_federated_learning project. I still have not been able to fix this though. I guess I will have to send my complaints to the open mind slack channel.

### Day 39:
**Update** - 5/08/2019
1. Today I got started with lesson 7. Having completed the project for lesson 6. I still have to follow up on some of my issues in the open mind channel but will do that tomorrow maybe.

2. I also looked at some content on how to get started with open source software development. It is a field I am interested. Feel free to reach out is you have any ideas or hacks.

### Day 40:
**Update** - 6/08/2019
1. Today I continued working towards completing the challenge course, now in lesson 7 and in my last month of internship, things are getting a bit more hectic as I am striving for complete understanding.

2. Also exploring ideas for the project showcase, might engage in the style transfer project as I have seen some cool results and will like to explore how that works, This depends a lot on how much time I have but will see how things go.

### Day 41:
**update** - 7/08/2019
1. Today I was able to complete my lesson on #l7_sec_federtd_learn . It was interesting to explore additional security measures for federated learning such as secret sharing and precision encoding.

This challenge has also been a huge motivational factor in pushing me to the completion of this course!

### Day 42:
**update** - 8/08/2019
1.Today I took a look at the project for #l7_sec_federtd_learn. Still not entirely clear so I went back to the course for a bit

### Day 43:
**Update** - 9/08/2019
1. Today, I saw this blogpost on the open mind slack channel shared by Andrew Trask (https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-differential-privacy-and-encrypted-computation-for-medical-imaging/) And I found it quite facinating the real world applications and importance of differential privacy in fields such as medicine.

2. Watched some more videos in the secures and private federated learning course section.

### Day 44:
**Update** - 10/08/2019
1. Today, I read @Abhishek Tandon blogpost on pate analysis, it was very detailed and I reccomend that everyone who is either struggling to understand pate analysis or wants to re-enforce their understanding of pate analysis. you can find the article by following this link (http://www.cleverhans.io/privacy/2018/04/29/privacy-and-machine-learning.html)

2. Today, I also dedicated time to going through the slack chanel as it was an extremely busy week for me. My interview is right around the corner so I have dedicated more time than usual to my data structures and Algorithms course on Udacity. I can't wait for this phase to pass as it is a very stressful one. But this platform has been a huge motivation for me.

### Day 45:
**Update** - 11/08/2019
1. Today I was not able to do much but I continued working towards the project for secured federated learning. I am trying to make the deadline of 20th of August so I can also partake in the Project showcase challenge all thinghs being equal


### Day 46:
**Update** - 12/08/2019
1. Today I started going through the final lesson in this project. The goal is to complete this lesson and the project before the 20th of this month so I can participate in the project showcase.

### Day 49:
**Update** - 15/08/2019
1. 1. I finally got to have my interview today. Funny how I was asked about differential privacy and its applications in the interview (Because I highlighted this in my application) and I was able to answer the questions thanks to all that I have learnt so far from this community! I am grateful and hoping for a good outcome. I'd resume the regular courses later tomorrow.

### Day 50:
**update** - 16/08/2019
1. Today, I have made a lot of progress with the last module in the notebook, I am currently still trying to understand one-hot encoding and federated learning for deep learning in general but I am making good progress.

### Day 51:
**Update** -17/08/2019
1. Few months, weeks and days later, I am pleased to announce that I have finally completed the content for the secure and private AI course. This courese has been an instrumental part of my learnings this summer especially the first model which introduced me to deep learning with Pytorch. Though I am done with the course content, my learning just began and I look forward to writing my first article regarding privacy preservation techniques and the importance of privacy.

2. I am grateful to everyone who has answered my numerous questions in this slack channel. @Arka, @Archit, @Gogulaanand R, @Dustin Gogoll, @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor, @Anna Scott, @Berenice, @sourav kumar, @Dammy, @Sumanyu Rosha, @Stark, @Abhishek Tandon, @ThienAn, @Henrique Mello, @Nawal to name a few.

3. I am also grateful to those who constantly share opportunities on the platform. That is something I follow very carefully and find a lot of value in.

### Day 52:
**Update** - 18/08/2019
1. Today I did some exploration for possible projects for the project showcase. I think I will most likely read some papers and try to recreate some of their models workinf with existing datasets. And try to incorporate some of the privacy preservinig techniques learnt from this course.

### Day 53:
**Update** - 19/08/2019
1. Today I did a bit of exploration with regards to my learning plan. thanks to the many people who have been able to answer my questions with regards to the importance of understanding other SWE tasks in learning AI.

2. I also did some revision of concepts learnt in the course by going through the slack channel and answering questuons/reading through the questions asked.

### Day 54:
**Update** - 20/08/2019
1. Took a look at the keystone project. About to get started with that.

2. Also revisited lesson 7 on Additive secret sharing to clarify some concepts learnt. Was on slack for the most of today.

### Day 55:
**Update** - 21/08/2019
1. Today I applied for the financial aid opportunity on data quest. I also started the python for data science learning path on Data quest. This decision has mostly been influenced by Yemi who gave me some career advice with regards to getting started in AI and the importance of knowing the basics associated with it.

2. I am also attending a webinar by JP morgan on how to ace a technical interview. This starts in a few minutes. 

3. Finally, preparing for a hackathon which is coming up on Friday. I am determined to try my best!

### Day 56:
**Update** - 22/08/2019
1. Today I read up on machine learning hackathon experiences and best practices in preparation for my hackathon tommorow. Hopefully I will be able to make use of Pytorch and a deep learning model. (https://towardsdatascience.com/qa-machine-learning-data-science-hackathons-921985c9e87d)

2. Also went through some leetcode coding interview problems. I find them interesting.

### Day 57:
**Update** - 23/08/2019
1. Today was a super productive day for me as I was involved in a hackathon with a lot of brilliant minds. First shout-outs to @Arka and @Sumanyu Rosha who were very helpful during the hackathon, helping me with several errors and queries. I did not win any award prize but I am currently sitting in the top ten out of all who contested.

2. The hackathon prompt was to develop a predictive model that correctly estimates the delivery time of goods from when they are picked up. Currently my model has a loss of 12 mins which is quite large but I am working on more feature exploration to this regard so that my model is training on relevant data only.

3. The first approach I worked on with @Arka is a NN regression model with linear neurons and a mean squared error loss function. From this I was able to learn how to use Pytorch beyond image datasets. I always had a fear for this.

4. After this I started exploring gradient boosting algorithms. XGBoost in particular. This gave me a better performance but I look forward to optimizing over the coming days! Thanks to everyone who answered my questions today. @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor, @Calincan Mircea Ioan, @Ankush Jain, @Ishan Arora, @Rana Tallal

### Day 58:
**Update** - 24/08/2019
1. Today, I continued working on my linear regression model. I have been doing some little feature exploration and I have so far been able to increase the model's score bit by bit. I need to read up more on Ensemblers and weight decay to ensure I can optimize my model but so far I like that it is getting better at least.

2. The end of the challenge is here but we still using pytorch and Neural nets! Big shoutout to @Arka and @Sumanyu Rosha for always answering my questions!

### Day 59:
**Update** - 25/08/2019
1. Today I reconnected with my #sg_nigerian group. Insightfull call with @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor, @Jethro Sam-Marcus and @Temitope Oladokun. I wish I could share what @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor shared with us on the call :joy::eyes:.

2. Read up more on multi-varite linear regression models. Exploring Sci-kit learn right now. Hoping to get my rating up.
