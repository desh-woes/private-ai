#Introduction
This file is a documentation of my learning journey over a 60 days period in attempt to optimise my learning from the `Secure and Private AI` challenge course by Udacity. 

>**Challenge Start Date:** 27th June, 2019.

### Day 1:
**Update** — 27/06/2019
1. Today, I will be working on understanding the formulas presented in the #l4_loc_glob_diff_priv module. They are quite confusing and require a lot of time to understand.

### Day 2:
**Update** — 28/06/2019
1. It's about time for me to complete the segment on Local and global Differential privacy. The projects in this segment have been super interesting. From learning that functions such as the sum and mean functions are not differentially private to learning about data conditioned sensitivity. I am really enjoying this part of the course. #60daysofudacity

### Day 3:
**Update** — 29/06/2019
1. Continued working in the local and global differential Privacy section. Almost done
2. Revisited the concept of data conditioned Privacy

### Day 4:
**Update** — 30/06/2019
1. Haha. Thanks for the tag @sumanyurosha!. Today,
I am resting after a long week of working. Hoping to get back to work fully energized tomorrow.

### Day 5:
**Update** — 01/07/2019
1. As always, @sumanyurosha is here to keep me in check! Thank you very much. I was actually busy with other stuff and forgot to post my updates.
Day 5: #60daysofudacity
Today I completed the lesson 4 on local and global differential privacy and I am currently looking at resources shared by @hrmello to help understand the formula's shared in episode 7, 8, 9 of the lesson.

### Day 6:
**Update** — 02/07/2019
1. Today I revisited episode 7, 8, and 9 of the lesson on local and global differential privacy. I also studied @rishisridhar96’s notes on github regarding the formalization of differential privacy. Finally, I did a bit of digging into the Laplacian Distribution.

### Day 7:
**Update** — 03/07/2019
1. I am now working on Lesson 6 i.e #l5_diff_privacy_dl. Still struggling with some formulas as well as access to internet but I remain dedicated to the course. There's some interesting concepts on how to modify differential privacy for deep learning and I'm looking forward to further exploration.

I'd also like to encourage @sumanyurosha and @ynawal to share their updates.

### Day 8:
**Update** — 04/07/2019
1. Today I continued exploring how differential privacy can be applied to deep Learning. It's exciting how you can train multiple models separately and bring them together to label an entirely different dataset.

2. The pate analysis is a bit confusing though. I am not able to go very in-depth because of internet constraints but tomorrow hopefully I'd get internet and explore the pate analysis even further.

3. Today I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96 and @hrmello to share their updates if they have not already done so.

### Day 9:
**Update** — 05/07/2019
1. Today I took a step back to explore a library that is used a lot in the field of Machine learning in general. I explored numpy and numpy operations. I could definitely see a lot of similarities between the numpy vector operations and the vector operations that are carried out in tensors too.

    It is a good library for beginners like me in the program to explore.

2. I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96, @hrmello, @sumanyurosha, @ynawal, @ash3ax to keep going with this wave and share their learnings with the rest of us :sunglasses:

### Day 10:
**Update** — 06/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning from the slack Channels through answering questions and reading answers to the questions asked by others. I think they are very insightful to go through and there's definitely a lot to learn from helping others as a beginner.

2. I'd like to encourage @undasu, @seeratpal91, and @shivshankar.hc to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 11:
**Update** — 07/07/2019

Today was a light day for me, I had to get some rest in preparation for the new week. However, today I was still able to:

1. Go over some python data structures and algorithms, in preparation for an interview. Today, I covered Array, stacks and queues.

2. I also covered some of the content on Pate analysis. I cannot say I fully grasp it yet but it's coming along quite nicely.

I'd like to thank everyone who reminds me to keep up with the challenge and I'd also like to challenge

@workwithpurpose, @sumanyurosha and @hrmello to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 12:
**Update** — 08/07/2019
1. Today I did some transfer learning of my own.:joy:, I started to explore the tensor-flow course on Udacity to see how applicable the learnings from Pytorch are in tensor-flow. Surprisingly, they are not so different at all, the general concept and approach to building deep learning models are almost the same and it is refreshing to know how much knowledge can be transferred from this course to other courses.

2. I'd like to thank @workwithpurpose and @arkachkrbrty for the constant motivation and I'd like to motivate @sumanyurosha, @gogulaanand02, @ash3ax to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 13:
**Update** — 09/07/2019
1. Today I went through the archives to visit old responses to some questions asked about the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning.

2. I also created my personal repository for [daily](https://github.com/desh-woes/private-ai) updates

3. Finally, today I'd like to thank @Arka and @Anna Scott for reminding me to share my updates as well as I motivate @Artur Freitas Gonçalves, @Elimu Michael, to share their updates.

### Day 14:
**Update** - 11/07/2019
1. After a very long day, today I was able to glance throught the content breifly as well as read through the tons of slack mesages I have been unable to read since yesterday when I was offline and at work till very late at Night. I am seriously waiting for this week to be over so I can spend much more quality time working on the course.

### Day 15:
**Update** - 12/07/2019
1. First, I'd like to thank @Arka, @Mohit and @Anna Scott for the constant motivation to post my updates. This week has been a really busy one for me and I have been really busy with work.

2. Today however I continued with covering some of the content on deep learning with Tensorflow. Today I was able to replicate the cats and dogs image classification exercise with Tensorflow. I am still struggling with running the model on Google collab as it tells me I run out of ram but I hope to figure that out soon as it worked earlier in the day with about 80% accuracy.

3. Today, i'd also like to encourage @Perez Ogayo, @Sumanyu Rosha, and @Elimu Michael to share their update.

### Day 16:
**Update** - 13/07/2019
1. Today I spent about an hour catching up on unread slack messages as I have been unable to do that since yesterday because of work. I am looking forward to finally resting tommorow and hope to get back on track with the course.

### Day 17:
**Update** - 14/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning about down-sizing, max pooling which are used for image classification algorithms in deep learning.

### Day 18:
**Update** - 15/07/2019
1. Today I was finally able to resume work on the secure and private AI course, I was not able to make the like Q&A session with Robert Wagner but I watched the video on youtube and got some tips regarding Differential privacy's current limitations and the areas of growth.

2. It is always refreshing getting expert tips. I want to thank @Mohit and @Arka for the constant motivation for me to share my updates. It has been tough in the past week but now I feel much more refreshed and good to move on with the course and engaging with the community more.

3. I'd also like to challenge @Sumanyu Rosha, @Elimu Michael, @Henrique Mello to share or keep sharing their updates if they have not already.

### Day 19:
**Update** - 16/07/2019
1. Finally back on track, today I completed the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning. I got stuck many times but was helped a lot today by @Ateniola Oluwatobi Victor and @Gogulaanand R. Thank you both for aiding my learnings. I really appreciate.

2. I'd like to motivate @Anna Scott, @Mohit, @Arka, @Abhishek Tandon, @Stark, to keep doing great stuff and pushing boundaries with this course. I have been seeing a lot of amazing posts.

3. Finally, I am looking for a buddy to help me with completing the project for differential privacy in deep learning. It is a bit confusing and I need guidance to work on it tomorrow, if you are available, please let me know.
